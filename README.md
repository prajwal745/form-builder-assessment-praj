# Form Builder â€“ Fullstack Application

The source code is split into:

- `frontend/`: React + Vite frontend with Tailwind CSS and modern UX
- `server/`: Node.js backend with Express, Prisma ORM, and MySQL support

## ðŸ”Œ API Endpoints

- `GET /api/forms` â€“ Get all forms
- `POST /api/forms` â€“ Create a new form
- `GET /api/forms/:id` â€“ Get a form by ID (with questions)
- `POST /api/forms/:id/responses` â€“ Submit form responses

This is a production-ready fullstack web application that allows users to:

- Create forms with multiple questions (text fields, dropdowns, file uploads)
- View the list of all created forms
- Fill out and submit responses for any form
- Store all data securely in a database (Prisma + MySQL)

## Feature that could make the form builder experience better
As a future improvement, I would add drag-and-drop question ordering and real-time form preview, so users can visualize exactly how the form will appear while building it.
